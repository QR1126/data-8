    "You are invited to complete a survey about your experiences in data science courses and other programs on campus. Your responses to this survey will be used to understand the strengths and weaknesses of current campus offerings. It will also be used to improve data science education at Berkeley and at other campuses around the country that are now adopting many aspects of the Berkeley curriculum. Participation is OPTIONAL. Your participation in the study will not affect your grades. None of your instructors will see your individual responses or whether you participated. The survey should take about 10 minutes. Please complete the survey here: https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3qPunChbfla88VE\n",
